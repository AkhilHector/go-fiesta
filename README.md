## go-fiesta

`go-fiesta` is an attempt to write a media server & a http middleware using `go`.

Although this is my primary attempt to draw implications on `Go` programming language, I tried my best to write good code.

### Things to Consider :
+ `main.go` is a media server which will support content like Video, Audio, Photos and other documents[mostly PDF].
+ `server.go` on the other hand is only an attempt to mock the node's version of a http-middleware.

### Performance :
- NOTE : Since this is an attempt to mock the node's version of a media server and a http middleware, comparisions will be made with regard to `go` & `node.js`
- Tests Coming Soon !!

### Setup & Install `go` :
+ Step 1 : Primarily you must have `go` binary, so it can be downloaded [here](https://www.golang.org)
+ Step 2 : After performing the `tar` operation and if you have exported the PATH then you are ready to run the code.
+  After step 1 and 2 are done then `go run main.go`.
